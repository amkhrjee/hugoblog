I am Aniruddha. I love making software and building systems. I am from Kolkata, India. I am in the final year of my Bachelor's in Computer Science & Engineering at Tezpur University.

I have a [separate website](https://amkhrjee.xyz) listing all my projects. Alternatively, you can checkout my [GitHub](https://github.com/amkhrjee).

I maintain a [list](https://resources.amkhrjee.xyz) of recommended learning resources for a range of CS, ML & Math topics (you can expect some more fun stuff there).

I can be reached via [email](mailto:amkhrjee@gmail.com).
